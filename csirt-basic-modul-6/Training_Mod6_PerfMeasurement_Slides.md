## Section 1: Performance Analysis

### Why Analyze Team Job Performance?

- New threats require a fresh look at workflow, tools and processes
- Changing tools can make your workflow and processes ineffective
- As your team grows, effectiveness could degrade
- With new team members inefficiencies can be introduced
- You'll want to leverage team strengths and improve weaknesses
- As your team matures you'll want to move up the maturity model
- Your team becomes empowered to take it upon themselves to improve their operation
- Bottom line: Continuous quality improvement is always a good thing!

### Tips for a Successful Performance Improvement Cycle

- Focus on important workflows, processes, and tasks
  - Frequently performed
  - Inconsistent execution
  - Under your control to improve
  - Put others in the "parking lot"
- Use appropriate measurements and metrics
  - Remember "You get what you measure"
  - Metrics must result in appropriate incentives
- Involve team members

## Section 2: Measurement Models

### Align Measurement with IM Phases

1. Plan and prepare
1. Detect
1. Triage
1. Analyze
1. Respond
1. Conduct post-mortems and lessons learned sessions

Plan and prepare

- Policy and process?
- Contact key partners?
- Review policies with management and other internal partners?
- Internal process to update processes?

Detect

- How do incidents come in?
- Does the team proactively search for new incidents?
- Do you have appropriate alarms set?
- Do written processes accurately reflect what you should be doing?

Triage, Analyze

- Resource usage per incident?
- Recurring incident versus a new one?
- Process for reviewing new and upgraded tools?
- How often do you detect the "root cause?"

Respond

- Incidents reopened or flagged as "duplicate"?
- How to remove the malware?
- How to prevent recurrence?
- Policy on constituency communications?
- Policy on public communications?
- When to involve PR and Legal?

Plan and prepare

- "How can we get better at our jobs?"
- Policy and procedure to improve other procedures?
- Procedure to converse with teams in your organization about recommended improvements?

### Maturity Model Assists in Performance Measurement

Each capability can have different level of maturity

A maturity model:

- Is a collection of proven best practices through which effective processes can be subscribed to a CSIRT
- Is used to appraise and diagnose the state of practices within an organization
- Offers a basis for improvement inside a CSIRT and the organization as a whole
- Analyzes what makes a formalized and consistent process for a CSIRT and organization

### Leverage Existing Maturity Models

- Level 1 Initial
  - Focus on process improvement
- Level 2 Managed
  - Processes characterized for projects and are often reactive
- Level 3 Defined
  - Processes characterized for the organization and are proactive
- Level 4 Quantitatively Managed
  - Processes unpredictable, poorly controlled, and reactive
- Level 5 Optimizing
  - Focus on process improvement
