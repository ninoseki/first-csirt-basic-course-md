Agenda
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
Define ways to measure a CSIRT's effectiveness
Clarify how to use performance analysis
Use incident management issues and indicators to measure performance
Describe a maturity model 
Identify evaluation models
Practice measuring the performance of a CSIRT





















Section 1: Performance Analysis
New threats require a fresh look at workflow, tools and processes
Changing tools can make your workflow and processes ineffective
As your team grows, effectiveness could degrade
With new team members inefficiencies can be introduced
You'll want to leverage team strengths and improve weaknesses
As your team matures you'll want to move up the maturity model
Your team becomes empowered to take it upon themselves to improve their operation
Bottom line: Continuous quality improvement is always a good thing!

Why Analyze Team Job Performance?
Tips for a Successful Performance Improvement Cycle
Focus on important workflows, processes, and tasks
Frequently performed 
Inconsistent execution
Under your control to improve
Put others in the "parking lot"
Use appropriate measurements and metrics
Remember "You get what you measure"
Metrics must result in appropriate incentives 
Tips for a Successful Performance Improvement Cycle
Involve team members
Inclusion and involvement leads to shared commitment
Share what they do well and where they could improve
Work with QA department if available
Consider using an external consultant and facilitator
Interview your constituency, management, and partners
What the CSIRT does well
The key improvement areas


Performance Improvement Flow
Establish high- level plan, resources and timeframe
Gain management support

Maturity Model Assists in Performance Measurement
Each capability can have different level of maturity
A maturity model: 
Is a collection of proven best practices through which effective processes can be subscribed to a CSIRT
Is used to appraise and diagnose the state of practices within an organization
Offers a basis for improvement inside a CSIRT and the organization as a whole
Analyzes what makes a formalized and consistent process for a CSIRT and organization
Offers a process that helps withperformance measurement
Leverage Existing Maturity Models

Level 5Optimizing
Focus on process improvement
Processes measured and controlled
Processes characterized for the organization and are proactive
Processes characterized for projects and are often reactive
Processes unpredictable, poorly controlled, and reactive

With regard to performance measurement and maturity models, how do you know you are measuring the right things?

MaturityModels
Maturity is an indication of how well an organization governs, documents, performs and measures its activities. For instance, what are the steps taken to perform a certain service? Are these steps written down? What are the different roles of the team members? Are these well-defined? How is performance measured? Is it measured regularly? 

Maturity
Maturity is not a state it's a continuous process.

Thus it has to be re-assed regularly

The them is growth, not be in some state


CSIRT Maturity
SIM3 : Security Incident Management Maturity Model 

Created by a Taskforce to "Certify CSIRT Teams" 

Goals:
Helps teams to get better
Is lightweight
Encourages maturing

Certification process in place for TF-CSIRT members 
CSIRT Maturity Models
SIM3 is continuously developed
In 2015, supported by NCSC.nl SIM3 was extended to the 

CSIRT MATURITY KIT 

Maturing Maturity
Five categories with 40+ parameters
Parameters receive between 0 – 4 points
Each parameter has a required minimal score

Quick Check


Do we have a business plan? 

Do we understand CSIRT maturity?

What are the relevant legal frameworks? 

FOUNDATION

Do we have a mandate?

Who are our clients/constituents?

 Is it clear what authority and responsibility we have? 

ORGANISATION 
Is the minimum staffing required to function?

Is there an official 'code-of-conduct'?

Do we have a clear policy for training our team members?

Are we connected to the right (social) networks? 

HUMAN
Do we have the right (digital) tools to support our key processes?

 For instance, secure communication, detection systems, etc. 

Do we have fallback systems? 

TOOLING
Do we have a clear plan for (political, legal, PR) escalation?

Are key processes (detection, resolution, prevention, etc.) well defined and documented?

Is there a process for auditing/improving these key processes? 

PROCESSES
Answers the following questions

Are we aware of this?

Is this aspect formalized?

Are we obliged to do this?

How do we measure and enforce this?
Parameters
0 = not available / undefined / unaware
1 = implicit (known/considered but not written down, "between the ears")
2 = explicit, internal (written down but not formalized in any way)
3 = explicit, formalized on authority of CSIRT head (rubberstamped or published)

4 = explicit, audited on authority of governance levels above the CSIRT head (subject to control process/audit/enforcement)
