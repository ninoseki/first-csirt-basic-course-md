## Agenda

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Define ways to measure a CSIRT's effectiveness
- Clarify how to use performance analysis
- Use incident management issues and indicators to measure performance
- Describe a maturity model
- Identify evaluation models
- Practice measuring the performance of a CSIRT

## Section 1: Performance Analysis

### Why Analyze Team Job Performance?

- New threats require a fresh look at workflow, tools and processes
- Changing tools can make your workflow and processes ineffective
- As your team grows, effectiveness could degrade
- With new team members inefficiencies can be introduced
- You'll want to leverage team strengths and improve weaknesses
- As your team matures you'll want to move up the maturity model
- Your team becomes empowered to take it upon themselves to improve their operation
- Bottom line: Continuous quality improvement is always a good thing!

### Tips for a Successful Performance Improvement Cycle

- Focus on important workflows, processes, and tasks
  - Frequently performed
  - Inconsistent execution
  - Under your control to improve
  - Put others in the "parking lot"
- Use appropriate measurements and metrics
  - Remember "You get what you measure"
  - Metrics must result in appropriate incentives
- Involve team members
  - Inclusion and involvement leads to shared commitment
  - Share what they do well and where they could improve
  - Work with QA department if available
  - Consider using an external consultant and facilitator
- Interview your constituency, management, and partners
  - What the CSIRT does well
  - The key improvement areas

### Performance Improvement Flow

- Establish high- level plan, resources and timeframe
- Gain management support
- Assemble your team
- Collect performance data
- Analyze data
- Develop improvement plan
- Update management and other stakeholders
- Execute and report on your progress

### Universal: General Improvement Areas

- Overall effectiveness
- Communication
- Consistency
- Timeliness
- Overall effectiveness
- Communication
- Consistency
- Timeliness
- Productivity
- Morale
- Management
- Business benefit

### Learning Check

What are some challenges you could face in improving performance over multiple locations, particularly among other countries?

## Section 2: Measurement Models

### Align Measurement with IM Phases

1. Plan and prepare
1. Detect
1. Triage
1. Analyze
1. Respond
1. Conduct post-mortems and lessons learned sessions


### Align Measurement with IM Phases

Plan and prepare

- Policy and process?
- Contact key partners?
- Review policies with management and other internal partners?
- Internal process to update processes?

Detect

- How do incidents come in?
- Does the team proactively search for new incidents?
- Do you have appropriate alarms set?
- Do written processes accurately reflect what you should be doing?

Triage, Analyze

- Resource usage per incident?
- Recurring incident versus a new one?
- Process for reviewing new and upgraded tools?
- How often do you detect the "root cause?"

Respond

- Incidents reopened or flagged as "duplicate"?
- How to remove the malware?
- How to prevent recurrence?
- Policy on constituency communications?
- Policy on public communications?
- When to involve PR and Legal?

Conduct post-mortems and lessons learned sessions

- "How can we get better at our jobs?"
- Policy and procedure to improve other procedures?
- Procedure to converse with teams in your organization about recommended improvements?

### Maturity Model Assists in Performance Measurement

Each capability can have different level of maturity

A maturity model:

- Is a collection of proven best practices through which effective processes can be subscribed to a CSIRT
- Is used to appraise and diagnose the state of practices within an organization
- Offers a basis for improvement inside a CSIRT and the organization as a whole
- Analyzes what makes a formalized and consistent process for a CSIRT and organization
- Offers a process that helps withperformance measurement

### Leverage Existing Maturity Models

- Level 1 Initial
  - Focus on process improvement
- Level 2 Managed
  - Processes characterized for projects and are often reactive
- Level 3 Defined
  - Processes characterized for the organization and are proactive
- Level 4 Quantitatively Managed
  - Processes unpredictable, poorly controlled, and reactive
- Level 5 Optimizing
  - Focus on process improvement

### Learning Check

With regard to performance measurement and maturity models, how do you know you are measuring the right things?

### MaturityModels

### Maturity

Maturity is an indication of how well an organization governs, documents, performs and measures its activities. For instance, what are the steps taken to perform a certain service? Are these steps written down? What are the different roles of the team members? Are these well-defined? How is performance measured? Is it measured regularly?

### CSIRT Maturity

- Maturity is not a state it's a continuous process.
- Thus it has to be re-assed regularly
- The them is growth, not be in some state

### CSIRT Maturity Models

SIM3 : Security Incident Management Maturity Model

- Created by a Taskforce to "Certify CSIRT Teams"

Goals:

- Helps teams to get better
- Is lightweight
- Encourages maturing

- Certification process in place for TF-CSIRT members

### Maturing Maturity

- SIM3 is continuously developed
- In 2015, supported by NCSC.nl SIM3 was extended to the

CSIRT MATURITY KIT

### Quick Check

Five categories with 40+ parameters

- Parameters receive between 0 – 4 points
- Each parameter has a required minimal score

### FOUNDATION

- Do we have a business plan?
- Do we understand CSIRT maturity?
- What are the relevant legal frameworks?

### ORGANISATION

- Do we have a mandate?
- Who are our clients/constituents?
- Is it clear what authority and responsibility we have?

### HUMAN

- Is the minimum staffing required to function?
- Is there an official 'code-of-conduct'?
- Do we have a clear policy for training our team members?
- Are we connected to the right (social) networks?

### TOOLING

- Do we have the right (digital) tools to support our key processes?
- For instance, secure communication, detection systems, etc.
- Do we have fallback systems?

### PROCESSES

- Do we have a clear plan for (political, legal, PR) escalation?
- Are key processes (detection, resolution, prevention, etc.) well defined and documented?
- Is there a process for auditing/improving these key processes?

### Parameters

Answers the following questions

- Are we aware of this?
- Is this aspect formalized?
- Are we obliged to do this?
- How do we measure and enforce this?

- 0 = not available / undefined / unaware
- 1 = implicit (known/considered but not written down, "between the ears")
- 2 = explicit, internal (written down but not formalized in any way)
- 3 = explicit, formalized on authority of CSIRT head (rubberstamped or published)
- 4 = explicit, audited on authority of governance levels above the CSIRT head (subject to control process/audit/enforcement)
