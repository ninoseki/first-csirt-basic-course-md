Policy Types
Policies that a CSIRT needs to have in place to ensure incident, vulnerability, artifact, and site information is protected:

A policy should outline essential characteristics for a specific topic area to provide all necessary information to help implement the policy. 
Content is a definition of behavior in a certain topic area. Content lays out the strategy for a policy.
When a policy has been defined, it's crucial to test the validity of that policy in a real-world situation.
Policy Components
Attributes
Content
Validation
Interaction of people and equipment, placement of operations center and data center, and safe storage of non-electronic data
LAN, firewall, IDS, VPN
Most secure software and browsers
Mobile technology, BYOD
CSIRT Workplace and Infrastructure Policies

CSIRT Workplace and Infrastructure Policies
Make sure your security policies match the way your organization works

Attribute
Description
Objective
Resolve customer web site outage
Definition
Quickly analyze, identify cause, restore services and document resolution and how to avoid in the future.
Function Descriptions
All the functions listed above are documented in the policies and procedures manual. 
Availability
Service is not made available unless QA criteria are verified
QA
On each page submission the current data is stored so only the last page on which "submit" was not pressed will be lost. 
Interactions and Info Disclosure
Work with our management and the Organization's PR department to produce press release if the outage was noticeable by customers or if it was detected and documented by a security organization. Our policy is to always reveal the minimal necessary to inform our customers. 
Interfaces with other services
As incident is closed data will be entered into our internal data bases, including resolution and how to prevent future outages of this time. 
Priority
Customer Web Site outages are priority 1 (on our scale of 1-5) 
Clearly Document Your Services
Policy Example: Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
For disaster recovery and business continuity, identify risks and build a mitigation and recovery plan in keeping with the needs of your organization 
Good example: NASDAQ moved its primary servers further away from its disaster recovery servers
Bad example: NYSE left its disaster recovery plan untested and was down for 2 days during Superstorm Sandy
Establish Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Policies Up Front
High-level steps to building your disaster recovery and business continuity policy/plan:
Define the scope 
Clearly articulate assumptions 
Build list of disaster scenarios and recovery goals (SLAs)
Define continuity and recovery strategy for each scenario
Coordinate plan with other teams 
Obtain management approval 
Schedule and execute disaster recovery practice drills
Revisit and revise plan at scheduled intervals



















When a threat to an organization is detected, how does a policy help? How does a procedure help?

Section 2: Building Relationships
Full Authority
Full permission to act on behalf of constituency

No Authority 
Acting only in advisory capacity
Assured strong sponsor within management
 
Building the Relationship Between CSIRT and Constituency
An Informed Constituency is Essential
Outbound communications
Email updates
Intranet
Presentations and workshops
Inbound data collections
Incident feedback
Formal periodic surveys
External communications
Media and press releases
Security bulletins
 

 
Know Your Community Partners
Developing relationships in the community with members of these groups can maximize a CSIRT's effectiveness during incidents
Vendors
Law enforcement
Press
Academics
Peers
CSIRT groups (e.g., FIRST, TF-CSIRT)
Business-oriented groups (e.g., ISACs) 

In your organization, which methods would you use to communicate with constituencies and why? Which methods are not appropriate for your organization?
