2. Detect
Controls and procedures should be in place to manage security incidents
Not all information security events indicate an attack
Accidental
Technical
Non-technical
Ensure that incidents are documented
Share relevant information
Training Module 3, CSIRT Operation, Version 2, © 2016 FIRST
2. Detect
Key Steps:
Monitor and log system and network activity
Discover and communicate
Collect symptoms and information
Collect situational awareness information—internal and external
Log activities, results, and decisions for later analysis
Gather and store digital evidence
Update needed changes to documentation
Training Module 3, CSIRT Operation, Version 2, © 2016 FIRST
3. Triage
Address the most potentially damaging impacts to the organization
Severity of the incident determines priority
Before you react, check the information available
Have a list of standard questions to begin the process of evaluating the situation: When did the problem start? What triggered it? What are the short-term and long-term business impacts?
Work quickly and efficiently
Take good notes
4. Analyze
Incident Analysis: Assess the severity and determine the urgency
Identify the possible causes
Translate the symptoms into potential causes
Do not announce a threat or leak
Do not make assumptions based on the incident reporter's information
Evaluate the situation and verify your data


Malware Analysis
Don't use your computer to test for malware! Don't test for malware on a live network in your organization!
Two types of analysis: 
Static analysis: Analyzing code that is not running at the time of analysis
Dynamic analysis: Analyzing code that is running at the time of analysis
Malware: executable content with unknown functionality that is resident on a system
Make sure that you know why you are running tests for malware
Digital Media Analysis
Forensic analysis of a system based on a cycle of data gathering and processing the information gathered
The more accurate and complete the data, the better and more comprehensive the evaluation can be
Isolate the computer or network on which a threat has been detected 
Focus on data from systems that aren't running and perform your analysis on a copy of the data
Capture information in accordance with its expected lifespan
Remember that the vast majority of files have not been used at all in the last year and deleted file information can survive intact for months or years

Digital Media Analysis
Option 1: Capture volatile information about processes and network connections, file attributes, configuration files, logfiles, and assorted other files 
Option 2: Halt the machine, remove the disks, and make copies of the data for forensic analysis
How to proceed?
Copy individual files
Make a backup
Copy individual disk partitions
Copy the entire disk 
Network Traffic Analysis
Network traffic analysis focuses on traffic performance 
NetFlow and IPFIX help collect this information
Incident analysis looks deeper into communication: Wireshark, tcpdump, and Splunk for wired and wireless media
Wireless can be used to locate unauthorized stations; can use Wi-Fi or GSM
Two modes of capture: session data and full data capture

5. Respond
Contact the local CSIRT, or a local correspondent whose position is related to security
Resources:http://www.first.org/members/map/ https://www.trusted-introducer.org/ 
Standard security email addresses 
Standard security web page 
whois and domain name

Disseminate Information 
The level at which information is disseminated depends on the severity and scope of the attack or vulnerability
Notification can provide an authoritative answer, stop users from guessing at the impact of the vulnerability, and prevent them from opening support cases 
CVSS provides a standardized method for rating IT vulnerabilities and determining the urgency of response
6. Conduct Post-Mortem and Lessons Learned Sessions
After an incident occurs, take time to conduct a post-mortem session on history, prevention, and impacts
Use the "five whys" to get to a root cause
Can result in new or changed:
Requirements for information security controls
Threat and vulnerability information
Information security incident management plan
Share the post-mortem with the entire CSIRT and at a high level outside of the CSIRT
How do you conduct a post-mortem session?

Section 3: Identifying and Responding to Attacks
Exploiting Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities: Errors that can be exploited
Intersection of three elements:
System susceptibility or flaw
Attacker access

Deliberate technical incidents
Overloading network access
Crashing the network
Exhausting resources
Non-technical incidents
Breaches of physical security
Accidental damage to hardware
Extreme environmental conditions
System malfunctions
Uncontrolled system changes
Botnet: Internet-connected computers that can be used for DDoS
Other Types of Attacks
Malware
Website defacement
Phishing
Data breaches 
Target attacks and APTs 



Phishing and Email Headers
Email headers determine where a message is sent and they record the path through each mail server 
Using online tools may give the manager of an email application total control over the email headers
Read message headers by using an online tool or read from the bottom of the header
Take steps to minimize damage from a phishing scam:
Change passwords or PINs 
Place a fraud alert on credit reports
Contact the bank or the online merchant directly
Close any accounts accessed or opened fraudulently
Routinely review bank and credit card statements
How do you weigh the impacts of different kinds of attacks?

Training Module 3, CSIRT Operation, Version 2, © 2016 FIRST
How To Handle Attacks
Put together an information security incident management policy
A "kit" that allows consistent and appropriate responses to threats and closures of vulnerabilities
How To Handle Attacks: Policies
Outline of the processes, responsible persons, authority, and reporting lines when a threat occurs
Regular reviews
Related awareness and training initiatives within the organization
Directed at every person having legitimate access to its information systems and related locations
Severity ratings for threats
Suggested timeline for responding to attacks
How To Handle Attacks: Policies
Identify:
Objectives
Interested parties internally and externally
Vulnerabilities
Roles
Benefits
What is the quality of your policies to handle attacks? What is the number one item you would like to add to your policies?
Learning Check
Training Module 3, CSIRT Operation, Version 2, © 2016 FIRST
Section 4: Communication
Communication of Vulnerabilities and Threats
Selected recipients: Sending notifications only to recipients affected by the security vulnerability
Often used when an organization is small 
Used when a product is a service 
Can notify only customers that fit into a certain profile
Public notification: Making notifications visible to all 
Can identify all affected customers
Useful if products are sold via third parties
Any notification sent to customers 
Selected recipients or public notification based on ability to identify affected recipients and not mutually exclusive
Can also group notifications by vulnerability
Security Bulletin Format
Consider medium, type, structure, and graphical layout:
Text, HTML, PDF, proprietary formats?
Free text, XML?
Email, Web, possibly RSS or product self-check?
Contingency plan: CDs, DVDs, USBs
Training Module 3, CSIRT Operation, Version 2, © 2016 FIRST
Security Bulletin Language
Make it bland and factual
Between formal and informal 
Short sentences
Consistent expressions 
Not too academic or technical
If possible, translate into languages spoken by the majority of the customer base
Template text can help the translation
Point to the original English-language version
Training Module 3, CSIRT Operation, Version 2, © 2016 FIRST
Security Bulletins: Internal Review 
Security bulletin must be reviewed to ensure that it contains all the necessary information and is accurate
Developers 
Customer support 
Dedicated support people 
Legal 
PR
CSIRT owns the security bulletin
Security Bulletins: Push and Pull Notifications
Push model:
Can be configured to suit recipients' needs
Can be sent to pagers, mobile phones, and email
Pull model:
Device periodically checks for new security bulletins 
Can automate the process of receiving and preprocessing the security bulletin
Recipients nominate who receives security bulletins
Security bulletins sent to everyone should be available without registration; security bulletins sent only to customers should require registration
Security Bulletin Maintenance
Decide:
When to change the document revision number
Whether recipients need to be notified of the change
Depends on:
Which kinds of changes warrant a revision number 
When recipients will be notified about changes

In The News
Sometimes an incident can put your organization front and center in the news
What do you do?
What protocols do you follow?
Public Relations
Turn all externally-facing communications over to your PR team
Don't reach out to the press unless authorized
Redirect press to appropriate PR staff
Prevents misinformation or speculation
Stays clear and concise
Aligns internal and external messages
Your organization may designate you to speak


Handling the Press
Speak only if you are designated to speak to the press
Only say what can be printed
Prepare your answers 
Ask for questions in advance
Only the truth
Only the facts
Create a "holding" statement
Review the final article

Section 5: Testing, Verifying, and Improving Your Process
Ongoing Assessment
Schedule regular checking and testing of information security incident management processes and procedures to highlight potential flaws and problems that can arise during the management of information security events, incidents, and vulnerabilities
Treat your CSIRT similar to a city emergency response team
Foster smooth and effective communications between other teams, internally and externally
Ongoing Assessment
Check for trends and patterns that may help identify the need for controls or approach changes
Conduct information security testing, particularly vulnerability assessment, following an IT-oriented information security incident
Conduct vulnerability assessments on a regular basis, not just in response to incidents
Regularly check and test processes and procedures around information security incident management
