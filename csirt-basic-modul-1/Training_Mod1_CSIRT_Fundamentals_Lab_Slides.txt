Lab Scenario
It is 1991 and Yugoslavia is splitting into multiple countries. One of the new governments has asked you to set up a new CSIRT for it. This CSIRT will have responsibility for protecting the central governmental assets.
Each team will address this fictional request and address the questions presented during the lecture. Feel free to fill in any blanks in knowledge with any scenario to which your team agrees.
