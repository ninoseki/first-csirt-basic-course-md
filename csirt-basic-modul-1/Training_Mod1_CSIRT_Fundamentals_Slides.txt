Consider a Separate CSIRT Department
Questions to ask to determine whether a specialized CSIRT is needed outside of the IT department:
What needs does the constituency have?
What are the critical assets that must be protected?
What types of incidents are frequently reported?
What computer security problems exist?
What type of response is needed?
What assistance and expertise is needed?
What is the current advanced warning/vulnerability notification setup?
Which processes are required?
Who will perform what role?
Is anyone currently performing that role?
