## Agenda

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Categorize levels of information sources
- Establish how to work with open-source and proprietary intelligence
- Identify methods for gathering and handling critical information
- Define processes that allow information sharing and exchange
- Practice gathering information from various sources

## Section 1: Categorizing Information Sources

### Information Sources and Types

- Information sources provide critical data for CSIRTs that can be used to identify, analyze, and resolve vulnerabilities
- Information sources are then categorized into three types:

### Primary Information Source

A primary information source is, generally, the first person to discover a vulnerability or report it to the CSIRT

### Secondary Information Source

A secondary information source is a security database, article, or journal whose data can be used to analyze and/or resolve the vulnerability

### Tertiary Information Source

A tertiary information source is a report that synthesizes data from secondary sources or from your own analysis of similar incidents or vulnerabilities

### Information Sources in Use

| Vulnerability | One of your users finds a URL that asks for a login and password and sends the suspicious email to the CSIRT immediately
Information Sources in Use |
| Primary Information Source | |
| The CSIRT looks through three security articles and the Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE) database to assess the severity, commonality, and means of removal for this vulnerability |
| Tertiary Information Source | The CSIRT scans an internal database for reports compiled by the CSIRT team on similar incidents or vulnerabilities |

### Phishing Example

- Your organization is being targeted by a phishing attack
- You need to gather as much information as possible to resolve the incident
- Classify information as primary, secondary, and tertiary

### Phishing Example: Primary Information

- Who was the intended target of the attack?
- What is the URL and hostname of the attacker?
- What was the social engineering method?

- URL
- Social engineering method
- Sender email

### Phishing Example: Secondary Information

- Who is the owner of the URL and what is his or her location?
- What is the sender's name and location?
- Has anyone already been phished inside organization?
- What type of data has been compromised?
- How was the system initially accessed?
- Which passwords were used to access the system?

- Sender IP address
- Spoofed or not
- Geo location
- Known campaign internally
- IP address
- Owner of domain
- Geo location
- Hosting service provider

### Phishing Example: Tertiary Information

- Are there reports about similar phishing incidents in the past?
- What other attacks, if any, have been documented online on this URL or domain?

- URL content
- URL reputation
- Known campaign externally

### Circle of Information

- Sender IP address
- Spoofed or not
- Geo location
- Known campaign internally
- URL
- Social engineering method
- Sender email
- IP address
- Owner of domain
- Geo location
- Hosting service provider
- URL content
- URL reputation
- Known campaign externally

### Learning Check

If the primary, secondary, and tertiary information sources about an incident differ from each other, what do you do?

## Section 2: Types of Information

### Types of Information

Types of common information you might need to gather:

- IP address (source and destination)
- Domain name
- Internet service provider (ISP)
- Email address
- System logs

### Open-Source Intelligence

- Open-source intelligence is information made available for public consumption that can be accessed over the Internet by anyone at any time
- Types of open-source intelligence:
  - nslookup
  - ht://Dig
  - Google
  - Social media

### Proprietary Intelligence

- Proprietary intelligence describes a technology owned exclusively by a single company that carefully guards knowledge about the technology or the product's inner workings
- Types of proprietary intelligence:
  - Maltego
  - Deep Magic
  - Cuckoo Sandbox

### Learning Check

What are the protocols in your organization for the types of information that can or cannot be shared, and how the information will be distributed?

## Section 3: Information Gathering Process

### Information Gathering Process

Gather/Handle => Verify/Score => Save => Share

- When researching a vulnerability, the information you collect is your weapon against it, so it is imperative that you be thorough
- When a vulnerability is detected, a CSIRT will need to accumulate all relevant information to identify the threat

### Information Gathering Process

- When researching a vulnerability, the information you collect is your weapon against it, so it is imperative that you be thorough
- When a vulnerability is detected, a CSIRT will need to accumulate all relevant information to identify the threat

### Gathering and Handling Information

There are two forms of information gathering: proactive and reactive.

- Proactive information gathering is forecasting the possibility of a threat and taking the necessary precautions to avert it
- Reactive information gathering is waiting for a threat to happen and reacting appropriately to that particular type of threat

### Gathering and Handling Information: Proactive

- Proactive information gathering example: Signing up for RSS feeds
- Other forms of proactive information gathering:
  - Regular system checks
  - Periodic CSIRT team drills
  - Subscribing to email lists
  - Setting the appropriate level of logging and checking periodically
  - Developing a background script for analysis

### Gathering and Handling Information: Reactive

- Reactive information gathering example: Using Google to research the threat, its effects, and how to properly eradicate the vulnerability
- Reactive information gathering is any attempt at gathering information made after a threat is detected

### Verifying and Scoring Collected Information

The verification process begins with your information source

- If you have a primary information source, your verification is as easy as speaking with that source
- If you have only secondary information sources, additional research might be required for proper verification
- Apply a score to information once it is verified

### Saving Information for Analysis

- All information collected should be saved and stored for analysis
- This becomes proactive information and is beneficial for:
  - Training and tools for future CSIRT members
  - Possible information sharing for other CSIRTs and organizations
  - Future analysis of the effectiveness of the CSIRT
- Use a file system or Incident Management system

### Importance of Sharing Information

- Sharing information is reciprocal in its benefits
- Without the sharing of information, open-source intelligence would be far less beneficial and vulnerabilities would be more difficult to identify

### Establishing and Maintaining Sharing Relationships

- Creating and maintaining relationships is crucial to the success of a CSIRT
- CSIRTs commonly establish relationships with:
  - Other CSIRTs at neighboring/like organizations
  - ISPs
  - Social media outlets

### Learning Check

In which situations are differences in the way team members gather information helpful to your team?

In which cases is varying from the norm not helpful?
